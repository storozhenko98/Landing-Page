                    <p>The aim of this paper is to tie together the Enlightenment ideas regarding Materialism and Instrumental Reason with Pierre Saint-Amand’s thought in his “Hostile Enlightenment” article. The paper will be a quadripartite, and will include the following: (1) a description of Julien Offray de la Mettrie’s materialist philosophy and his rejection of Cartesian reason, as well as a discussion of his ideas’ relevance and influence; (2) a description of the Marquis de Sade’s philosophy, particularly his materialism; (3) a reading of Pierre Saint-Amand’s “Hostile Enlightenment” with a particular focus on his thoughts regarding Sade; (4) a conclusion, in which I will argue that Sade is a direct representation of the Enlightenment giving birth to its own antithesis.</p>

                    <h3>"Phenomenology and Metaphysical Realism"
                    written at Kent State University, Spring 2020</h3>

                    <p>The recent re-turn to metaphysical realism in Continental Philosophy, evident in the emergence of the Speculative Realism movement, has posed challenging questions to phenomenology. Most importantly, is phenomenology compatible with metaphysical realism? Meillassoux, Harman, and Sparrow charge phenomenology with being, respectively, correlationist, a philosophy of access, and metaphysically agnostic or idealist. However, their charges do not go unanswered. Zahavi responds to the challenges by pointing out how phenomenology is compatible with, and indeed inclined toward realism. He does so by looking at concrete interactions between phenomenology and realism, as well as addressing what realism is and what it entails within phenomenology. Following Zahavi, as well as my own investigation into Husserl's phenomenology, I conclude that phenomenology is compatible with metaphysical realism.</p>
